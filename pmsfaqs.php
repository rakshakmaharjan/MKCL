					<h5>14. How should an Investor invest in shares? <span><i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></span></h5>
				</a>
				<div id="pmsfaq14" class="collapse" data-parent="#accordion">
					<p>Set Investment Goals:<br>
						The first step towards investment is setting out investment goals. Investment goals are very important to mark the desired success.  It’s like creating a road map like, whether the investor is buying a house, buying a car, saving for retirement purpose or for kid’s college fund from the investment. The investors should understand their investment objectives (capital preservation, regular cash flow requirement, wealth maximization, etc.) and investment horizon. Based on the investment objectives and the horizon, investor should formulate strategies (short-term, long-term, loss/profit booking, IPO/FPO/auctions, analysis modality, etc.)<br><br>
						Assess Risk Appetite:<br>
						All investments involve some degree of risk. Investors' goals decide their risk taking ability. A rule of thumb in investment can be laid out as higher the risk of an investment, the higher potential for higher return or losses. Not everyone, however, can take risks with their money over to a certain level. Not everyone can handle the ups and downs of the capital market. To some investors, risking their money against a potential higher rate of return may not be worth the stress that follows along with, while some investors tolerate the risk of losing money for the possibility of gaining higher returns. For the latter kind of investors, aggressive investments such as growth stocks are the best option.<br><br>
						Diversification:<br>
						As the saying goes, “Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.” Diversification means distributing investment fund across different categories of stocks. The different categories could include different industries, different size of companies, different geographies the companies operate in, different business models, etc. Proper diversification helps minimize unsystematic risks.<br><br>
						Consult a Portfolio Manager:<br>
						It is advised to entrust investment fund to a portfolio manager, who will professionally manage the fund if an investor:<br>
						Doesn’t have sufficient time or expertise for all the associated risks and activities,<br>
						Doesn’t want to spend down time for investment management; and<br>
						Doesn’t want all the mental pressure from handling one’s own fund.</p>
